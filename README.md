# Sophos Connect Upgrade Script to version 2.2.90 for Windows Installations

# This software checks to see if Sophos Connect is installed and what version

# Checks if installed version is 2.2.90 and if so sends message of already upgraded

# If Sophos Connect version is not 2.2.90 it proceeds to create a folder, download installation file, silently install, logs to created folder

# Checks for a temporary folder and creates if doesn't exist (C:\TE)

# If not installed writes message "Not Installed"
